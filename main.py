## PART 1: Debugging ############################################
# Find the bug in this piece of code. Note that with the height 72, your code should print "mesosphere" based off the Space Travel slides on slide 7. 
##########################################################
height = 72

if height > 20:
  print('stratosphere')
elif height > 50:
  print('mesosphere')
elif height > 100:
  print('space')
else:
  print('troposhere')

#### PART 3: Practice with conditionals #####
############################################
# Now that we are off planet üåç and into space, we flew off into the dark abyss of space. Not much longer, we landed on a planet at the same time the space ship's location identifier broke. However, when we checked our distance traveled from Earth, our distance meter reads 155 million miles.
# We have to fix this issue to identify the planet we have landed on. 


# First, set a variable `distance` equal to 155 since that is our distance meter's current reading. To reprogram your space ship to figure out the planet you landed on based off the distance meter, write an if/elif/else conditional that meets the requirement of the following:

# If distance meter reads between 90-404 million miles (inclusive), then it landed on planet Mars (print Mars)
# If distance meter reads 405-859 million miles (inclusive), then it landed on planet Jupiter (print Jupiter)
# If distance meter reads 860-1900 million miles (inclusive), then it landed on Saturn (print Saturn)
# If distance meter reads 1901-2787 million miles (inclusive), then it landed on Neptune (print Neptune)

## PART 4: Conditionals within conditionals
##############################################
# Now that you've been able to identify which planet you have landed on, you need to reconfigure your system based off the planet you've arrived in to find a place to settle your space ship for the night. You've set up a couple markers around your space ship and measured their distances from the the flag that your teammates found around 200 miles from your space ship. 
# The commanders says that you must follow these code requirements to determine if your space ship location is safe:
# If the markers read "green" then you must check:
# 1) If the marker is within the 400 mile radius of the flag (inclusive), print "safe"
# 2) If the marker is more than 400 mile radius of the flag, print "not safe"
# If the markers read "yellow" then you must check:
# 1) If the marker is within the 300 mile radius of the flag (inclusive), print "safe"
# 2) If the marker is more than 300 mile radius of the flag, print "not safe"
# If the markers read "red" then you must check:
# 1) If the marker is within the 200 mile radius of the flag (inclusive), print "safe"
# 2) If the marker is more than 200 mile radius of the flag, print "not safe"
# First start with setting a string variable marker_color to "red" & another integer variable marker_distance to 145
# NOTE: You are comparing strings and also comparing integers and you will have conditionals within conditionals in your code
